								<h2><a href="https://github.com/ShahnajRUllah/fitbit_user_data_analysis">Fitbit Tracker - User's Data Analysis</a></h2>

								<h3><b>Business Overview</b></h3>
								<p>Bellabeat is a small successful high-tech manufacturer which produces health-focused products geared towards women.
								Given their success they have the potential to expand into the global smart device market. Their products include a 
								watch or bracelet that tracks sleep, stress and activity. They also have a bottle to track hydration levels. These trackers 
								connect to the Bellabeat app which allows the tracking of their daily habits to help women make better wellness decisions. Bellabeat
								also offers memberships for personalized health, nutrition and lifestyle guidance. </p>
								
								<h3><b>The Business Task:</b></h3>
								<p>The founder of Bellabeat had assigned us, the marketing team, with the task of exploring how consumers are 
								using non-Bellabeat smart devices. Using the insights we had to come up with 
								a marketing strategy recommendation that can be applied to one of Bellabeat's product. 
								This may help introduce new growth opportunities so that the company can 
								potentially become a larger player in the global smart devices market space. 
								</p>
							
								<h3><b>The Dataset:</b></h3>
								<p>The founder had suggested using the <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit">Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data</a> 
									<i>(CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic">Mobius</a>).</i>
									This is a public data coming from a credible organization which supports the open science movement. The data 
									was gathered from users that consented to sharing their usage data in a survey. No personal information
									is in the data ensuring their privacy. The dataset has data about the user's daily sleep, weight, heart rate and activity level. <br>
									<br>	For our analysis, we used the following data sets:
									<ul>
										<li>daily_activity</li>
										<li>hourly_calories</li>
										<li>hourly_intensities</li>
										<li>hourly_steps</li>
									</ul>
									<b>Important remarks about the data:</b>
									<ul>
										<li><b>Outdated dataset:</b> The data was collected in 2016 thus it is important to note that the analysis may not be the most 
									reliable in terms of giving us an up-to date marketing strategy to implement. The tech space evolves fast
									so ideas from the insight may already have been implemented by competitors today. </li>
										<li><b>Sample size:</b> The dataset is said to be collected from 30 users, this sets us at the minimum number of samples
										that should be collected in order for the distribution of our analysis to be reflective of the average population based on 
										the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/central_limit_theorem.asp">Central Limit Theorem</a>.</li>
										<li><b>Lack of user gender details:</b> The dataset does not specify the gender of the users and it is also 
											unclear whether the goal of the company is to become a larger global player by reaching out to more women globally
											or to extend its services to being inclusive of other gender identities. Based on Bellabeat's purpose, we are 
											assuming the goal is to grow by reaching more women globally, and thus we are assuming the data was randomly
											and fairly collected across 30 female users of various races and age ranges. 
										</li>
										<li><b>Missing units:</b> Some of the data does not specify the units such as for distance we are uncertain whether it is in meters, km or miles.
											It is also unclear how level of intensity for being active is measured therefore where the units have not been specified, we will simply refer to it
											as 'units'.
										</li>
								</ul>
								</p>

								<h3><b>Data Processing:</b></h3>
								<p>
									<h4><b>Data cleaning in Google spreadsheet -</b></h4>
									<ol>
										<li><b>Removed duplicates:</b> Google spreadsheet was first used to remove any duplicate records. However, no duplicates were found
											in any data sets.</li>
									</ol>
									<h4><b>Transforming data in R -</b></h4>
									<ol>
										<li><b>Corrected the 'Date' and 'ActivityHour' column format:</b> The datasets were uploaded to R and by default the data type for the 
											date columns was 'chr'. We casted them to date/ date-time where appplicable.</li>
										<!-- <span class="image main"><img src="images/libraries_upload_files.png" alt="" /></span> -->
										<span class="resizable-image">
											<img src="images/bellabeat/code_snippet/reformat_date_column.png" alt="" />
										</span>
										<li><b>Column names:</b> It is advisable to always ensure column names follow 
									a consistent and legible naming convention set by the organization. In our case we did not change the column names as they all
									had followed a consistent format that was fairly easy to read. </li>
									</ol>
								</p>

								<h3><b>Data Exploration:</b></h3>
									<h4><b>Data exploration in R -</b></h4>
									<ol>
										<li><b>Merged hourly_calories, hourly_intensities and hourly_steps data sets: </b> The three data sets had a common column 'ActivityHour'
											on which the sets can be joined to make the analysis step easier.</li> <br>
											<span class="resizable-image"><img src="images/bellabeat/code_snippet/r_joined_hourly_data.png" alt="" /></span> <br>
											<span class="resizable-image"><img src="images/bellabeat/code_snippet/r_joined_table_cont.png" alt="" /></span></li>
										<li><b>Verifying number of users:</b> Using R's n_distinct() function we counted the number of users and saved the information in a table 
											as a summary. We can see the data sets actually has 33 users info logged and not 30.
											<span class="resizable-image"><img src="images/bellabeat/code_snippet/count_user.png" alt="" /></span> <br>
											<span class="resizable-image"><img src="images/bellabeat/code_snippet/Table_count.png" alt="" /></span>
										</li>
									</ul>
										</li>
									</ol>
									<h4><b>Data exploration in BigQuery -</b></h4>
									With the data sets we have, we used SQL to obtain a summary of the averages of each user daily and hourly logs. <br><br>
									<ul>
										<li><b>Querying a summary of the daily averages by user:</b>
<pre><code>SELECT Id, 
	CAST(AVG(Calories) as INT) as AvgCalorie, 
	CAST(AVG(TotalSteps) as INT) as AvgStepTotal, 
	CAST(AVG(TotalDistance) as INT) as AvgTotalDistance, 
	CAST(AVG(VeryActiveMinutes) as INT)as AvgVeryActiveMinutes, 
	CAST(AVG(FairlyActiveMinutes) as INT) as AvgFairlyActiveMinutes, 
	CAST(AVG(LightlyActiveMinutes) as INT) as AvgLightlyActiveMinutes,
	CAST(AVG(SedentaryMinutes) as INT) as AvgSedentaryMinutes
	FROM FitbitTrackerData.daily_activity
GROUP BY Id;</code></pre>
										<b>Resulting output of the first 10 records in ascending 'Id' order:</b>
										<span class="resizable-image"><img src="images/bellabeat/code_snippet/daily_avg.png" alt="" /></span>
										</li>

										<li><b>Querying a summary of the hourly averages by user:</b>
<pre><code>SELECT Id as Id, 
	CAST(AVG(Calories) as INT) as AvgCalories, 
	CAST(AVG(TotalIntensity) as INT) as AvgIntensity, 
	CAST(AVG(StepTotal) as INT) as AvgStepTotal
FROM (SELECT
	hourly_calories.Id,
	hourly_calories.ActivityHour,
	hourly_calories.Calories,
	hourly_intensities.TotalIntensity,
	hourly_intensities.AverageIntensity,
	hourly_steps.StepTotal
FROM FitbitTrackerData.hourly_calories
JOIN FitbitTrackerData.hourly_intensities
	ON hourly_calories.Id = hourly_intensities.Id AND hourly_calories.ActivityHour = hourly_intensities.ActivityHour
JOIN FitbitTrackerData.hourly_steps
	ON hourly_steps.Id = hourly_intensities.Id AND hourly_steps.ActivityHour = hourly_intensities.ActivityHour)
	GROUP BY Id;</code></pre>

										<b>Resulting output of the first 10 records in ascending 'Id' order:</b>
										<span class="resizable-image"><img src="images/bellabeat/code_snippet/hourly_avg.png" alt="" /></span>
										</li>
										<h4><b>Data exploration in Google spreadsheet -</b></h4>
										The resulting outputs were saved as a CSV file and then uploaded to Google 
										spreadsheets for some quick brief analysis. The outputs show 33 records total, 
										reflective of the averages for each user. <br>
										We used spreadsheet's AVG() built in function to summarize the average of all users for the daily and hourly logs.
										The results were rounded to whole numbers. <br><br>
										<li><b>User's daily averages:</b>
											<span class="resizable-image"><img src="images/bellabeat/code_snippet/daily_average.png" alt="" /></span> <br>
											Here we can see the average user burns 2282 calories, takes 7519 steps total, walks a total distance of 5 units, 
											is very active for a total of 20 minutes and sedentary for a total of 999 minutes daily.
										</li> <br>
										<li><b>User's hourly averages:</b></li> <br>
											<span class="resizable-image"><img src="images/bellabeat/code_snippet/hourly_average.png" alt="" /></span> <br>
											Here we can see that on an hourly basis, the average user burns 97 calories, takes 316 steps total and is active on 
											an intensity level of 12 units.
										</li>
									</ul>

									<h3><b>Data Visualization in R:</b></h3> 
									With the data being transformed to a more useful format, we can now explore some user trends through visualization. <br><br>
										<ul type="circle">
											The following code snippet was used to generate the different graphs. <br><br>
												<span class="resizable-image"><img src="images/bellabeat/code_snippet/Graph_visualization.png" alt="" /></span>
											<li><b>Total number of steps taken versus calories burned on an hourly basis: </b> Below we can see from the density of the data points that most users 
												took between 0-2500 steps on an hourly basis burning upto 250 calories. We can also see a positive correlation between the two variables, more steps taken 
												potentially burns more calories. Here it's important to clarify that correlation does not mean causation thus it does not mean taking more steps is the reason
												for burning more calories with absolute certainty.<br><br>
												<span class="resizable-image"><img src="images/bellabeat/visualization/h_calories_steps.png" alt="" /></span></li>
											<li><b>Activity intensity and the total calories burned on an hourly basis:</b> Below we can see more users having an activity intensity of 0 - 50 also burning 
												upto 250 calories hourly. A positive correlation exists between the intensity and calories burned as well.<br><br>
												<span class="resizable-image"><img src="images/bellabeat/visualization/h_intensity_calories.png" alt="" /></span></li>
											</li>
											<li><b>Total number of minutes being very active versus the total calories burned on a daily basis:</b> The visualization below shows more user density below 
												12.5 minutes showing more users are very active for less than 12.5 minutes on a daily basis. A positive correlation is shown between having a higher 
												number of active minutes and burning more calories.<br><br>
												<span class="resizable-image"><img src="images/bellabeat/visualization/d_active_calories.png" alt="" /></span></li>
											</li>
											<li><b>Total distance walked versus the total calories burned on a daily basis:</b> Below we can see the user data points are somewhat fairly distributed across 
												having walked a total distance of between 0 - 10 units daily. Those having walked for a total of 10 units burned between 1500 - 4500 calories total and those 
												having walked 0 units burned between 0 to 2700 calories. A positive correlation can also be seen between the total distance walked and the number of calories 
												burned.<br><br>
												<span class="resizable-image"><img src="images/bellabeat/visualization/d_distance_calories.png" alt="" /></span></li>
											</li> 
											<li><b>Total number of steps taken versus the total calories burned on a daily basis:</b> Below we can see a fair distribution of the data points between 0 - 15,000 
												total steps taken daily similar to the total distance walked versus calories burned trend we saw earlier. These users burn upto 4000 calories. As with all other 
												graphs, a positive correlation is seen between the total steps taken and number of calories burned.<br><br>
												<span class="resizable-image"><img src="images/bellabeat/visualization/d_steps_calories.png" alt="" /></span>
											</li>
											<h3><b>Visualization in Tableau:</b></h3>
											<li><b>Understanding the correlation between the number of sedentary minutes versus the number of calories burned daily:</b> Below we can see how there exists a 
												negative correlation between the number of sedentary minutes and the number of calories burned. We can see the average users are sedentary for between 650 to a 
												little over 1300 minutes, i.e. 10.8 to 21.7 hours, and they burn between 1500 to 3500 calories.  <br>
												<span class="resizable-image"><img src="images/bellabeat/visualization/sed_vs_calories.png" alt="" /></span>
											</li>

											
											<h3><b>Summary:</b></h3>
											<p>
												From the FitBit user data analysis a few remarks can be made:
												<ol>
													<li>
														Users use their trackers to actively monitor their daily and hourly activity levels i.e. the intensity of their activeness and duration, the distance they 
														walk and the total steps they take as well as the number of calories they've burnt.
													</li>
													<li>
														We also noticed a positive correlation between being active at a higher intensity, having longer very active minutes, having a higher total distance walked, 
														walking more steps and the number of calories burned. 
													</li>
													<li>
														A negative correlation was observed between being sedentary for more minutes versus the number of calories burned.
													</li>
													<li>
														It was also noted that the average user burns a total of 2282 calories, takes 7519 steps total, walks a total of 5 distance units, is very active for 
														20 minutes, is fairly active for 13 minutes and sedentary for 999 minutes (16.7 hours). According to the 
														<a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/average-steps-per-day">MedicalNewsToday</a> there's no strict rule about how many
														steps one should take daily however the International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity recommends 
														inactive adults to incorporate at least 30 minutes of brisk walking, which is equivalent to about 3,000 – 4,000 steps a day while active, 
														healthy individuals can aim for 10,000 steps. Thus the average user gets under the healthy individual's goal but at the minimum above the 
														recommended range for an inactive adult. 
													</li> 
												</ol> 
											</p>

											<h3><b>Recommendations:</b></h3>
											<p>
												Based on the analysis we would recommend creating a new app feature that encourages a more active lifestyle to stay healthy through  
												the addition of some notifications. The notification will notify an individual when they have met the daily goal of a lesser inactive adult,
												i.e. the 3000 - 4000 steps mark to mark the day's minimum milestone being reached. Additionally, once an individual crosses that mark we will set up a challenge 
												to encourage the individual to push themselves further by setting a goal of reaching 10,000 steps by the end of day to become more active.
